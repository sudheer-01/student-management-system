9.first positional parameter is indicated by /
10.req -> client, res -> server
11. __dirname , it automatically searches for file(login.html) in current working directory
12.to see output of nodejs file, we use browser using port number ...app.listen(protnumber); 
13.electronic device-> h/w port(physical/digital connectivity)  , 2 types of ports , communication -> s/w port 
14.app.listen(8082) is opened in only one computer(current computer). So to open in lan(entire network) we use ip address.
